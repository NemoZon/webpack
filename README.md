## Loaders
Loaders are transformations that are applied to the source code of a module. They allow you to pre-process files as you import or “load” them. Thus, loaders are kind of like “tasks” in other build tools and provide a powerful way to handle front-end build steps. **Loaders can transform files from a different language (like TypeScript) to JavaScript or load inline images as data URLs**. Loaders even allow you to do things like import CSS files directly from your JavaScript modules!
